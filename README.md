# Bloom
> The place for retail businesses to create and sell their own gift cards. **Welcome to Gift cards 2.0**

## Motivation
Gift cards are well known as a way for retail businesses to boost sales and bring in new customers.

In a period of crisis gift cards are an accessible way for customers to show their support for their favourite businesses, in simple terms customers are making an advance payment for goods or services.

For businesses gift cards are an income stream open 24/7 regardless of whether their stores can be open.

## Why?
Right now many retail businesses need to add a lifeline to their business. **And there's nothing better than accepting advance payments for goods and services.**

## Gift cards 2.0
A gift card that grows in value...

Bloom's gift cards can earn interest. We give gift-card-creators the tools to configure how their gift card earns interest.

- all of the earned interest could be added to the gift card balance
- all of the earned interest could go directly to the gift-card-creator
- or any split

Resilient and persistent, nothing can stop Bloom's gift cards from being sold!

## System Overview
Bloom gives business owners the tools - a self-service portal - to create and sell their own gift cards.

Built on the promise of [Non-fungible tokens](https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/) we bridge token standards to enable access to the underlying protocols of DeFi.

We do this by wrapping tangible value, ERC-20 tokens, around unique ERC-721 tokens.

## User Stories
* Toby  (see Toby's user persona on [Milanote](https://app.milanote.com/1J9Phh1KiYulbj))
  - As a tent owner I want to sell my tent so that I can get some money back for it whilst ensuring its put to good use / responsibly used.
* Rachel  (see Rachel's user persona on [Milanote](https://app.milanote.com/1J9Pro1KiYulbl))
  - As someone in the market for a tent I'd rather rent than own a tent, to save money and to depend on less stuff.

## Key focus for UX
- Adding a tent to the marketplace - here's how it might look on mobile and desktop
- Automatically putting a tent back on the marketplace
- Communication / notifications that ensure the renter understands what is happening now that the rental period has come to an end

## How it works
### For tent sellers
- **List your tent** > Include some photos and a description
- **Sell your tent** > Get money for your idle tent
- **Save the planet** > When your tent is taken off your hands it will always be available here for rent
### For tent hirers
- **Find a tent to rent** > Choose from a wide range of good-quality used tents
- **Save money** > Pay for the rental and a refundable deposit
- **Select rental period** > Choose how long you want to keep the tent
- **Take care of the tent** > Once the rental period is up youâ€™re the custodian until the next renter comes along

## Status
Project has been submitted for judging, _HackMoney_ an [ETHGlobal](https://www.ethglobal.co/) hackathon.

## Next steps
We see an opportunity for local governments and municipalities to boost the value of Bloom gift cards as part of their strategic economic response to the Coronavirus crisis. Essentially an easy way for them to present a monetary incentive to consumers.
