## Why?
Bloom offers an easy way for business owners to add a lifeline to their business. Resilient and persistent, nothing can stop Bloom's gift cards from being sold!

**There's nothing better than advance payments for goods and services.**

## System Overview

## User Stories
* Toby  (see Toby's user persona on [Milanote](https://app.milanote.com/1J9Phh1KiYulbj))
  - As a tent owner I want to sell my tent so that I can get some money back for it whilst ensuring its put to good use / responsibly used.
* Rachel  (see Rachel's user persona on [Milanote](https://app.milanote.com/1J9Pro1KiYulbl))
  - As someone in the market for a tent I'd rather rent than own a tent, to save money and to depend on less stuff.

## Key focus for UX
- Adding a tent to the marketplace - here's how it might look on mobile and desktop
- Automatically putting a tent back on the marketplace
- Communication / notifications that ensure the renter understands what is happening now that the rental period has come to an end

## How it works
### For tent sellers
- **List your tent** > Include some photos and a description
- **Sell your tent** > Get money for your idle tent
- **Save the planet** > When your tent is taken off your hands it will always be available here for rent
### For tent hirers
- **Find a tent to rent** > Choose from a wide range of good-quality used tents
- **Save money** > Pay for the rental and a refundable deposit
- **Select rental period** > Choose how long you want to keep the tent
- **Take care of the tent** > Once the rental period is up youâ€™re the custodian until the next renter comes along
