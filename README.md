# Bloom Finance - Gift Cards that Grow!
> The place for retail businesses to create and sell their own gift cards. **Welcome to Gift Cards 2.0**

## Motivation
Gift cards are well known as a way for retail businesses to boost sales and bring in new customers.

In a period of crisis gift cards are an accessible way for customers to show their support for their favourite businesses, in simple terms customers are making an advance payment for goods or services.

For businesses, gift cards are an income stream open 24/7 regardless of whether their stores can be open.

## Why?
Right now many retail businesses need to add a lifeline to their business. **And there's nothing better than accepting advance payments for goods and services.**

## Gift Cards 2.0
A gift card that grows in value...

Bloom's gift cards can earn interest. We give gift-card-creators the tools to configure how their gift card earns interest.

- all of the earned interest could be added to the gift card balance
- all of the earned interest could go directly to the gift-card-creator
- or any split between the two

Resilient and persistent, nothing can stop Bloom's gift cards from being sold!

## System Overview
Bloom gives business owners the tools - a self-service portal - to create and sell their own gift cards.

Built on the promise of [Non-fungible tokens](https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/) we bridge token standards to enable access to the underlying protocols of DeFi.

We do this by wrapping tangible value, ERC-20 tokens, around unique ERC-721 tokens.

## User Stories
* Alice
  - As a bakery owner I want to add an income stream whilst my business is closed so that I'm better placed to weather the impact closure has on my business.
* Bob
  - As a loyal customer I'd like to support my favourite local businesses so that they can continue to operate, and I can enjoy them, when the crisis is over.

## Key focus for UX
- Adding and listing Gift Cards on the marketplace
- Redeeming Gift Cards at the Point-of-Sale
- Viewing the Balance & Interest of the Gift Card
- Communication / notifications to the Gift Card Holder

## How it works

## Status

## Next steps
We see an opportunity for local governments and municipalities to boost the value of Bloom gift cards as part of their strategic economic response to the Coronavirus crisis. Essentially an easy way for them to present a monetary incentive to consumers.
