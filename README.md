# Bloom
> A place for retail businesses to create and sell their own gift cards. Welcome to Gift cards 2.0

## Motivation
Gift cards are well known as a way for retail businesses to boost sales and bring in new customers.

In a period of crisis Gift cards are an accessible way for customers to show their support for their favourite businesses, in simple terms they are making an advance payment for goods or services.

For businesses this is an income stream that is open 24/7 regardless of whether their stores can be open.

## Why?
Bloom offers an easy way for business owners to add a lifeline to their business. Resilient and persistent, nothing can stop Bloom's gift cards from being sold!

**Less tent ownership** means less tents need to be manufactured, saving viral resources and reducing waste disposal.

## Gift cards 2.0

## User Stories
* Toby  (see Toby's user persona on [Milanote](https://app.milanote.com/1J9Phh1KiYulbj))
  - As a tent owner I want to sell my tent so that I can get some money back for it whilst ensuring its put to good use / responsibly used.
* Rachel  (see Rachel's user persona on [Milanote](https://app.milanote.com/1J9Pro1KiYulbl))
  - As someone in the market for a tent I'd rather rent than own a tent, to save money and to depend on less stuff.

## System Overview
Once a tent is added to the marketplace it will always be available for rent; except during rental periods when the tent is being used by the renter.

For a quick overview of how this works go [here](https://github.com/kelvinlockwood/Rent-My-Tent/blob/master/marketplace_explainer.md). To understand every interaction between a tent seller and a tent hirer check out this [marketplace design doc](https://github.com/kelvinlockwood/Rent-My-Tent/blob/master/MarketplaceDesign_RentMyTent.pdf).

## Key focus for UX
- Adding a tent to the marketplace - here's how it might look on mobile and desktop
- Automatically putting a tent back on the marketplace
- Communication / notifications that ensure the renter understands what is happening now that the rental period has come to an end

## How it works
### For tent sellers
- **List your tent** > Include some photos and a description
- **Sell your tent** > Get money for your idle tent
- **Save the planet** > When your tent is taken off your hands it will always be available here for rent
### For tent hirers
- **Find a tent to rent** > Choose from a wide range of good-quality used tents
- **Save money** > Pay for the rental and a refundable deposit
- **Select rental period** > Choose how long you want to keep the tent
- **Take care of the tent** > Once the rental period is up youâ€™re the custodian until the next renter comes along
